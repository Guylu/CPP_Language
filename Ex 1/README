this program will take two numbers in a galua filed of the users choise, and will preform arithmetical operations
on those numbers, and also will divide the numbers into their prime factors.
the program will ensure that the galua field generated is valid and then preform all of the arithmetics as if it was
in the chosen galua field.
the prime factors list will be generated using rho algorithm and if failed with a brute force way.
the program will display the results to the user.
