Tesst file for cpp_ex1 summer course 2019.
created by Tomer Hochbaum.

version: 3

----------------------------------------------------
changes:
version 2:
1. added an assert test to see that you checked that two numbers given in the GCD function are from the same field.
2. fixed the length of getPrimeList to be 0 in a case of a prime number.

version 3:
added a test for p < 0.
added a test for p = 1 - make sure you abort as 1 is nit a prime number.
fixed some printings.
----------------------------------------------------

make sure to put the file in the same folder as all the other files of the program, and blacken any other main function in your program.

some tests compare the output - you should check that you got the right output.
all other tests use assert, and will abort if you fail.

read the comments printed in test 4 - you need to uncomment the lines there one by one.

If you have any suggestions or found a bug - please let me know.
